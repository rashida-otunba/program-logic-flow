// === //triple equals; checks for equality of value and type 
//will not coerce a value 

2==='2' //will be false because you cannot coerce a type 

undefined===null//false 

3===3 // true because both are numbers 


//use triple equals 99% of the time 

// !=//not equality; cousin of double equals 

// !==//strict non-equality; cousin of triple equals 

10!='10'//false because it is technically equal because they are the same value 

10!=='10'//true because they are not the same 


//you should always use the strict non equality !==
